# FAA AVSED Minecraft Challenge 2020 - Team Proper Bandits

## About

The FAA invites student participants who currently use Minecraft software to create a model airport from the ground up. The airport will include all required airside elements and students will receive weekly instruction from FAA staff with expertise in specific areas of airport development. With that information, individually or in small teams, students will research a local airport of their choosing and then recreate that airport in the virtual world of Minecraft!
